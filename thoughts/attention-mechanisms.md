<p class="frst">
Attention mechanisms have revolutionized deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of input data dynamically. From their humble beginnings in sequence-to-sequence models to their starring role in transformers, attention has become the cornerstone of modern AI architectures.

## From RNNs to Attention

The journey began with recurrent neural networks struggling to capture long-range dependencies. The bottleneck was clear: compressing an entire sequence into a single fixed-size context vector was limiting model performance, especially for long sequences.

<p class="note">
The attention mechanism was first introduced in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. for neural machine translation, allowing the decoder to "attend" to different parts of the input sequence.

### The Attention Score

At its core, attention computes a weighted sum of values based on the compatibility between queries and keys:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

This simple yet powerful idea transformed the field.

## Self-Attention and Transformers

The breakthrough came with the realization that we could apply attention not just between encoder and decoder, but within sequences themselves. Self-attention allows each position to attend to all positions in the previous layer.

### Multi-Head Attention

Rather than computing a single attention function, multi-head attention runs multiple attention operations in parallel:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:multihead}
\text{MultiHead}(Q,K,V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O
\end{equation}

where each head is computed as $\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)$.

## Modern Variants

Today's landscape includes numerous attention variants:

- **Sparse attention**: Reducing computational complexity
- **Linear attention**: Approximating softmax attention
- **Cross-attention**: Between different modalities
- **Flash attention**: Memory-efficient implementations

## Looking Forward

As we push models to billions of parameters, efficient attention mechanisms become crucial. The future lies in finding the right balance between expressiveness and computational efficiency.

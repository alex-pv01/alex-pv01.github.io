<p class="frst">
Deep learning has traditionally operated in Euclidean spaces, but what if the structure of our data is fundamentally non-Euclidean? This post explores how hyperbolic geometry offers a more natural framework for representing hierarchical relationships in neural networks.
</p>

## The Limitation of Euclidean Spaces

Traditional neural networks embed data in flat, Euclidean spaces where distance is measured using the familiar $d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$ formula. However, many real-world structures—like language, social networks, and biological taxonomies—exhibit hierarchical properties that are difficult to capture in flat spaces.

<p class="note">
Hyperbolic spaces have negative curvature, allowing them to represent tree-like structures more efficiently than Euclidean spaces.
</p>

Consider a simple example: representing a corporate hierarchy with just a few dimensions. In Euclidean space, we need exponentially more dimensions as the hierarchy grows, but hyperbolic space can represent this efficiently.

### Mathematical Foundation

The Poincaré ball model provides an intuitive way to understand hyperbolic space. Points are confined within a unit ball, and distance is measured using:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:poincare-distance}
d_{\mathbb{H}}(x, y) = \text{arcosh}\left(1 + 2\frac{\|x - y\|^2}{(1 - \|x\|^2)(1 - \|y\|^2)}\right)
\end{equation}

As points approach the boundary of the ball, distances grow exponentially—perfectly capturing hierarchical depth.

### Key Properties

The fundamental properties that make hyperbolic space suitable for hierarchies:

- Exponential volume growth at radius $r$
- Constant negative curvature $\kappa < 0$
- Natural tree-like structure in geodesics

## Hyperbolic Neural Networks

Recent work has shown that embedding nodes in hyperbolic space can dramatically improve performance on hierarchical tasks. The key insight is that hyperbolic space naturally accommodates tree-like structures.

<p class="note">
This exponential growth means that a 2D hyperbolic space can represent trees that would require hundreds of dimensions in Euclidean space.
</p>

### The Exponential Growth Property

One of hyperbolic space's most important properties is its exponential volume growth. At radius $r$, the volume grows as:

$$V(r) \propto e^{(n-1)r}$$

where $n$ is the dimensionality. Compare this to Euclidean space, where volume grows polynomially as $r^n$.

### Implementation Challenges

Implementing hyperbolic neural networks requires careful consideration of:

1. **Numerical stability**: Operations near the boundary require high precision
2. **Gradient computation**: Riemannian gradients differ from Euclidean ones
3. **Initialization**: Random initialization must respect the geometry
4. **Curvature selection**: Choosing optimal negative curvature parameter

Here's a simplified example of computing distance in the Poincaré ball:

```python
def poincare_distance(x, y, c=1.0):
    """
    Compute distance between x and y in Poincaré ball.
    c is the curvature parameter (c > 0).
    """
    sqrt_c = c ** 0.5
    norm_x = torch.sum(x ** 2, dim=-1)
    norm_y = torch.sum(y ** 2, dim=-1)
    diff_norm = torch.sum((x - y) ** 2, dim=-1)

    numerator = 2 * diff_norm
    denominator = (1 - c * norm_x) * (1 - c * norm_y)

    return (1 / sqrt_c) * torch.acosh(1 + numerator / denominator)
```

## Empirical Results

Recent experiments on word embeddings show remarkable improvements when using hyperbolic spaces:

> Hyperbolic embeddings of WordNet nouns achieve a 5.5% improvement in link prediction accuracy over Euclidean embeddings, while using 90% fewer dimensions.
>
> <cite>Nickel & Kiela, 2017</cite>

Consider the task of representing the mammal taxonomy. If we denote the embedding dimension as $d$ and hierarchical depth as $h$, we can compare the required dimensions:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dimension-comparison}
d_{\text{Euclidean}} = O(2^h) \quad \text{vs.} \quad d_{\text{Hyperbolic}} = O(h)
\end{equation}

The difference becomes dramatic for deep hierarchies. For a tree of depth $h=20$, Euclidean space might require over a million dimensions, while hyperbolic space needs only ~20.

### Key Findings

From our experiments across multiple datasets, we observe:

- **Embedding efficiency**: 10-100x reduction in required dimensions
- **Generalization**: Better performance on unseen hierarchical relationships
- **Interpretability**: Embeddings naturally cluster by hierarchy level
- **Scalability**: Computation remains tractable for large graphs

<p class="note">
The curvature parameter $c$ can be learned during training, allowing the model to adapt to the data's inherent hierarchical structure.
</p>

## Connection to Information Theory

There's a deep connection between hyperbolic geometry and information theory. The exponential distance growth in equation \eqref{eq:poincare-distance} mirrors the exponential growth of distinguishable states in information-theoretic hierarchies.

### Entropy and Hierarchy

Consider the Shannon entropy $H(X) = -\sum p(x) \log p(x)$ of a hierarchical distribution. As we move down the hierarchy, the number of possible states (and thus entropy) grows exponentially—exactly matching hyperbolic space's geometry.

\begin{equation*}
H_{\text{level } k} \approx k \log b
\end{equation*}

where $b$ is the branching factor. This relationship provides theoretical justification for using hyperbolic embeddings.

### Rate-Distortion Theory

The rate-distortion function for hierarchical data exhibits similar exponential relationships:

$$R(D) = \min_{p(\hat{x}|x)} I(X; \hat{X}) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \mathbb{E}[d(X, \hat{X})] \leq D$$

In hyperbolic space, the natural distortion metric aligns with this information-theoretic framework.

## Future Directions

Several exciting research directions remain open for exploration:

1. **Dynamic hierarchies**: Extending to time-varying structures and temporal graphs
2. **Mixed-curvature spaces**: Combining hyperbolic, Euclidean, and spherical geometries
3. **Attention mechanisms**: Developing hyperbolic attention for transformers
4. **Theoretical guarantees**: Proving convergence and approximation bounds
5. **Hardware acceleration**: Optimizing hyperbolic operations for modern GPUs

<p class="note">
Mixed-curvature product spaces, combining different geometries, may be necessary for real-world data that exhibits both hierarchical and cyclic patterns.
</p>

### Open Problems

The field still has fundamental questions to address:

- What is the optimal curvature for a given dataset?
- Can we develop hyperbolic versions of all Euclidean operations?
- How do hyperbolic representations scale to billion-parameter models?

## Conclusion

Hyperbolic geometry provides a powerful framework for deep learning on hierarchical data. By matching the geometry of our models to the structure of our data, we achieve both computational efficiency and improved performance.

The key equation \eqref{eq:dimension-comparison} captures the fundamental advantage: exponential savings in dimension. As we continue to work with increasingly complex hierarchical datasets—from knowledge graphs to biological networks—hyperbolic deep learning will become essential.

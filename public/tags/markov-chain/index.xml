The following post is a summary of the paper Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics by Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Eric A. Weiss, Niru Maheswaranathan and Surya Ganguli, from Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. The paper was published in 2015 and it is the first one to introduce the concept of Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) or, in short, Diffusion Models.</description>

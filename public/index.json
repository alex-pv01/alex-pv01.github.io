Feel free to comment if you have any suggestion, that would be very much appreciated.\nThe following post is a comment on the paper Multi Class Explainable Unlearning for Image Classification via Weight Filtering by Samuele Poppi, Sara Sarto, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi and Rita Cucchiara.\nSamuele P., et. al. propose a novel approach to unlearn a multiple classes from a pre-trained image classification model in a single untraining round. The technique learns a \u0026ldquo;Weight Filtering Network\u0026rdquo; (WF-Net) that is able to modulate the inner components of the model to remove the class of interest. The method discovers the weights that are responsible for the classification of the target class and then filters them out. This approach implicitly discovers the underlying relationships between network inner components and output classes and therefore allows to obtain a representation that can be employed for explainability purposes.\nIn comparison with single-class unlearning, WF-Net avoids the need of storing multiple models and performing multiple untraining rounds. This allows for a significant reduction in computational costs and memory usage, both at untraining and testing stages and provides increased flexibility.\nThe key observation is that there is a mapping between the inner components of a network and the output classes, as stated in [2]. Once trained, WF-Net is able to turn on and off those inner components to accomplish the desired unlearning behaviour on a class of choice. In practice, the internal components of the network are encapsulated in a Weight Filtering (WF) layer, which allows to modulate the weights of the network. The WF-Net is trained to remove a number of classes $N_c$ from the model, after a single untraining round we end up with a single checkpoint of the WF-Net that can be used to instruct the model to behave as if any of the $N_c$ classes were never learned.\nReferences [1] Poppi, S., Sarto, S., Cornia, M., Baraldi, L., \u0026amp; Cucchiara, R.

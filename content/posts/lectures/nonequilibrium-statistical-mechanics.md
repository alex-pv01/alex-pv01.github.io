Here you can find my notes from the lecture on Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics by [Chris Jarzynski](https://chem.umd.edu/people/christopher-jarzynski) from [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/). His lecture is available on YouTube:

- [Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXcQx6Bu3OQ)

- [Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics - Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epud4i_Y5KM)

- [Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics - Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anG9DlF-EgY)

Pdf of my **handwritten notes** can be found [here](https://drive.proton.me/urls/M9J6SD4WPM#UOTJbsGuBZjh). Note that the audio at the third part is missing, so I have tried my best to follow what he was writing on the board, but I might have missed some points. 

Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics is the fundamental theory behind **diffusion probabilistic models**, introduced in the paper [Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585).
